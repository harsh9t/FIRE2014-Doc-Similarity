There are two subfolders to this archive: queries and

popularized depends on the version of this archive.

Documents are CSV files with the following format:

  psuedo-term,start,end

Psuedo-terms are regions of speech that appear throughout the
corpus. Other documents may have similar psuedo-terms if regions were
deemed to be similar in the audio space. The start and end regions
mark where a given term appeared within an audio file. While
psuedo-term itself is not necessarily unique, the
(psuedo-term,start,end) generally is.
